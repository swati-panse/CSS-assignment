        <h1>web development</h1>
        <p>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for
            the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). This can include
            web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting,
            web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
            However, among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main
            non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding. Web
            development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to
            the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, or social
            network services.</p>

    <div class="main1">
        <h1>web development as an industry</h1>
        <p>Sinince the mid-1990s, web development has been one of the fastest growing industries
             the world. In 1995 there were fewer than 1,000 web development companies in the
            United States, but by 2005 there were over 30,000 such companies[citation needed] in
            the U.S. alone. The growth of this industry is being pushed by large businesses wishing
            to sell products and services to their customers and to automate business workflow.</p>
    </div>
  <div class="main2">
    <h1>security considerations</h1>
    <p>Web development takes into account many security considerations, such as data entry
        error checking through forms, filtering output, and encryption.[1] Malicious practices
        such as SQL injection can be executed by users with ill intent yet with only primitive
        knowledge of web development as a whole. Scripts can be exploited to grant
        unauthorized access to malicious users trying to collect information such as email
        addresses, passwords and protected content like credit card numbers.</p>
